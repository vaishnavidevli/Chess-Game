# Chess-Game

**Chess Game with AI and Graphics**

This Python project implements a fully functional chess game with both human and AI players. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Pygame library and a simple AI opponent using multiprocessing for move computation.

**Features**

Interactive GUI:

A visually appealing chessboard rendered using Pygame.

Interactive gameplay where players can select and move pieces using the mouse.

Highlighting of valid moves and last moves for better visual feedback.

**Chess Mechanics**:

Full implementation of chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

Checkmate and stalemate detection.

AI Integration:

AI opponent to challenge players.

AI uses multiprocessing to compute the best move without freezing the game.

Move Logging:

A move log panel displays the history of moves made in the game.

Supports undo and reset functionality.

Animations:

Smooth animations for piece movement.
